# BOARD — the open-work queue of record

- **Tree confirmed at:** `3808ebe9` (branch `task/K00-legA-board`, base `fable`).
- **Date:** 2026-09-03. Built by K00 Leg A (`refactor/K00_truth_reset.md`).
- **Suite:** 3497 of 3498 passing, per `refactor/J16_eq_header_type_extraction.md`'s
  Review (the last merged code unit). The sole expected failure is the ALSA host
  quirk `AudioManagerTest.PreloadCommonSounds`. The count grows; run it.
- **Items are confirmed against the tree at the tip above; nothing here is quoted
  from an older board.**

**Classes.** **A** live defect — a reachable path gives the wrong answer, silently
does nothing, or looks wrong. **B** implemented-but-unreached, or hygiene that
needs a code change. **C** needs Will's design decision. **P** process/doc.

**Rules.** One entry per open item. Anchors are file + function/class name, never
a line number. `Prov:` is the item number in the archived board
(`refactor/completed/deferred_archive_20260903.md`) and appears nowhere else. An
item marked *unconfirmed* names what would confirm it; nobody may scope a fix off
it without taking that measurement first.

---

## A — live defects

- **B001** (A) `src/client/movement/movement_state.cpp`
  `eqt::movement::MovementComponent::SetPositionState` (K07 moved it) —
  every arm ends in `SendSpawnAppearance`, so a server-forced pose cannot be
  applied without echoing it back, and its `AT_DIE` arm encodes a pose self never
  receives. Closes when: a non-sending internal setter exists and the death path
  (`OP_Death`/`OP_BecomeCorpse` for self), not the `AT_DIE` arm, drives self's
  `positionState`. Prov: deferred item 15.

- **B002** (A) `src/client/action/eq_action_handler.cpp` `EqActionHandler::toggleAutorun`
  — a `LOG_DEBUG` stub, and the only live consumer
  (`renderer_player_physics.cpp`'s `playerMovement_.autorun`) has zero writers, so
  three bound keys report success and do nothing. Closes when: a renderer-side
  setter is driven from the game side and a live keypress moves the player.
  Prov: deferred item 10.

- **B003** (A) auto-attack — 12 live runs with `/target` and `/attack` both
  confirmed in the log produced no swing. **Unconfirmed at this tip, needs a live
  eqemu session**; it may be the draw predicate, the animation, the attack timer
  or the test setup. Closes when: a live run shows a swing, or the defect is
  named. Prov: deferred item 27.

- **B004** (A) `include/client/graphics/ui/ui_layout.h` `centerPopup` — `popW`/
  `popH` are hardcoded 400/350 at every resolution; the archive records general
  and equipment slots drawn outside that frame and unreachable by mouse.
  **Unconfirmed at this tip, needs a rendered inventory popup or a static-panel
  hit-test.** Closes when: every drawn slot is inside the frame and clickable.
  Prov: archived board, "static-panel UI surface still untested after T54".

## B — implemented-but-unreached, and hygiene needing a code change

- ~~**B005** (B) the `UCSConnection` TU and header (under `src/client/` and
  `include/client/`, basename `ucs`) — 413 lines of live-looking code with zero
  callers.~~ **CLOSED by K15**: re-measured at `7c125b28` (comment- and
  string-filtered grep + the compiler) — zero references outside its own two
  files. Both files, the `CMakeLists.txt` entry and the commented
  `ConnectToUCS` call are deleted, with tombstones in `CMakeLists.txt` and at
  the call site in
  `LoginWorldComponent::WorldProcessSetChatServer`. The parsed `m_ucs_host` /
  `m_ucs_port` / `m_ucs_connection_type` were **kept** — the plan asked for them
  but they are NOT zero-reference: they carry the T13 wire contract and 13
  assertions in `test_login_world_flow.cpp` / `test_login_world_component.cpp`
  read them through public accessors. Prov: deferred item 4.

- **B006** (B) the S2 leftovers — **PARTLY CLOSED by K15**, two halves left.
  ~~`application_config.cpp`'s `irrlicht_renderer.h` include~~ **deleted** —
  re-measured at `7c125b28` and confirmed by the compiler. **The survey's claim
  was FALSE for `application_frame.cpp`**: it names no `IrrlichtRenderer` token,
  but it drives the renderer through `m_renderer->getDriver()`,
  `->processFrame()` and `->saveScreenshot()`, so removing the include gave
  three "invalid use of incomplete type" errors. The include is kept and this is
  the record — a name-token grep does not see a use through a typed member
  pointer; only the compiler does.
  ~~`door_manager.cpp`'s static `EverQuest::GetDebugLevel()`~~
  **replaced**: the gate is now the logging module's own level query
  (`ShouldLog` behind `LOG_DEBUG`/`LOG_TRACE` — user-initiated at DEBUG, every
  other door at TRACE) and the `include/client/eq.h` include is gone from that
  renderer TU. **STILL OPEN:** (1) `EverQuest::InitGraphics` still takes an
  `IrrlichtRenderer*` — K15 read it and hit the plan's STOP condition: inside
  `BridgeComponent::InitGraphics` the pointer reaches exactly two calls,
  `initLoadingScreen(const RendererConfig&)` and `initDeferredGraphics()`, and
  narrowing needs an interface that DOES NOT EXIST. The shape it would take is
  recorded in `refactor/K15_leftovers_and_dead_members.md`'s Review; do not
  invent it without a ruling. (2) the asset loaders
  (`include/client/graphics/eq/pfs.h`, `include/client/graphics/eq/wld_loader.h`)
  still live in `EQT::Graphics`. Prov: the S2 residue.

- **B007** (B) `include/client/skill/skill_data.h` `SkillData::endurance_cost` /
  `mana_cost` — declared, defaulted 0, and assigned nowhere in the tree, so both
  of `SkillManager::getSkillUseError()`'s resource refusals are unreachable and a
  skill that should fail for endurance proceeds. Closes when: the source data is
  found and loaded, or the fields and their branches are deleted. Do not invent
  values. Prov: deferred item 35.

- **B008** (B) `src/common/net/daybreak_connection_send.cpp`
  `DaybreakConnection::ValidateCRC` — its `default:` arm returns false with no log
  line, silently rejecting every packet for any `crc_bytes` other than 2 or 4.
  Closes when: the arm logs, or the case is proven unreachable and asserted.
  Prov: deferred item 41.

- **B009** (B) `tests/test_daybreak_connection_pcap.cpp` — reads `connect_code`,
  `encode_key` and `max_packet_size` raw off the wire, which is exactly the bug
  T21 fixed in production; it cannot fail if that fix regresses, and passes today
  only because eqemu's key is a byte-swap palindrome. Closes when: the test reads
  through the production path. Prov: deferred item 40.

- **B010** (B) `tests/test_irrlicht_camera_command.cpp`
  `CameraCommandRoundTripTest` — no `PrintTo` for the parameter type, so gtest
  names each case by hex-dumping an ASLR-randomised pointer and the eight ctest
  names are not stable identifiers. Closes when: a `PrintTo` or name generator
  gives stable names. Prov: deferred item 42.

- **B011** (B) `src/client/graphics/entity_size.cpp`
  `EntityRenderer::setEntitySize` — updates neither `collisionHeight` nor `deckZ`,
  so a resized boat's deck surface goes stale. Nothing in the game resizes a
  boat, so this is a documented limit, not a live defect. Closes when: both are
  recomputed, or the limit is asserted in a test. Prov: deferred item 38.

- **B012** (B) `src/client/action/action_dispatcher.cpp`
  `ActionDispatcher::clearTarget` — reachable only from a keybinding; no command
  registration exists in `command_processor_registration.cpp`, so a `--script`
  run cannot clear a target. Closes when: a command reaches it or it is proven
  keybinding-only by design. Prov: archived board, T39 dead-state follow-ups.

- **B013** (B) `src/client/graphics/renderer_slash_commands.cpp` `/newskills` —
  the only working skills-window toggle, registered in neither command registry,
  so it is invisible to `/help` and to tab completion and reachable only by a user
  who already knows the word. Closes when: it is registered, or renamed and
  merged with `/skills`. Prov: archived board, T143.

- **B014** (B) `src/client/graphics/eq/race_model_loader.cpp`
  `RaceModelLoader::preloadModelData` — calls
  `ConstrainedTextureCache::getOrLoad()` with an empty buffer whenever a JSON
  manifest exists but no EQE1 archive is configured: one guaranteed-to-fail call
  per composite name. Closes when: the call is gated on EQE1 being configured.
  Prov: archived board, T92.

- **B015** (B) `src/client/audio/midi_player.cpp` `MidiPlayer::loadSoundFont` —
  swaps a raw `tsf*` with no atomic or mutex; safe today only because its single
  call site runs before the audio thread exists, which the file's own comment
  records. Closes when: the swap is synchronised or the single-call-site
  precondition is asserted. Prov: archived board, T131.

- **B016** (B) `src/client/graphics/eq/` `RaceModelLoader::ensureModelDataLoaded`
  — ~20 unlocked `loadedModels_` reads across four TUs; a blanket lock
  self-deadlocks, so it needs a recursive mutex or a restructure.
  **Unconfirmed at this tip, needs a TSAN run** to show the warnings are still
  raised. Prov: archived board, T114.

- ~~**B019** (B) `include/client/eq.h` `EverQuest::m_guild_name` — declared and
  default-initialised, **zero references anywhere**.~~ **CLOSED by K15**:
  re-measured at `7c125b28`, still zero references; deleted. Prov: K01 Review.

## C — needs Will's decision

- **B017** (C) `src/client/guild/guild_component.cpp`
  `eqt::guild::GuildComponent::SendGuildInviteAccept` —
  prints "You have declined the guild invite." on a path the server processes as
  an accept. T318 confirmed the decline is **unfixable client-side** (the server
  tests an already-remapped value). The open half is user-facing wording, and no
  copy should be invented. Prov: deferred item 37.

- **B018** (C) first-person eye placement — `refactor/T301_first_person_eye_placement.md`
  is written and not dispatched; T309 landed the measured draw rule
  (`src/client/graphics/entity_first_person_draw.cpp`) but the eye sits at the
  static bbox crown, and Will judges the look on the live gate. Prov: deferred
  item 16.

- **B040** (C) server-sent placeables and doors are measured by no gate — the
  benchmark's `placeableObjectsBytes` (`tools/hwcaps/zone_bench_memory.h`) is
  summed over the zone's own S3D archive and never connects to a server, so
  eqemu's `object` and `doors` tables are counted by nothing. Closing it needs a
  live-client memory harness that does not exist; the decision is whether to
  build one. **(K15: renumbered from a duplicate `B019` — the ID collided with
  the `m_guild_name` item above. The one cross-reference, in
  `refactor/K00_truth_reset.md`, was fixed with it.)** Prov: the archived board's
  "SERVER-SENT PLACEABLES AND DOORS ARE UNMEASURED BY ANY GATE" section.

- **B020** (C) `include/client/graphics/constrained_renderer_config.h` — eight
  measured memory categories (zoneGeometry, s3dZoneSource, gpuTexture, vboEbo,
  eqe1Mapped, characterModels, placeableObjects, untracked) carry no configured
  budget, only baseline guards. The per-category ruling is owed. Prov: archived
  board, T69.

- **B021** (C) `scripts/ci/visual_gate.py` `untrackedBytes` — emitted and
  baselined but deliberately not asserted; gating it needs repeat-run data from a
  second machine first. Prov: archived board, T69.

- **B022** (C) `src/client/graphics/spell_visual_fx.cpp` — the data-driven spell
  visual layer is still entirely ahead: nothing consumes the `spells.eff` reader
  in place of the hardcoded resist/school vocabulary, and the spells whose
  `spell_affect_index` hits an empty padding record need a rendering ruling.
  Prov: archived board, T70.

- **B023** (C) `src/client/player/player_misc.cpp` `eqt::player::PlayerComponent::SendReport` — the wire
  shape does not match eqemu's `OP_Report` (pipe-delimited reported/reporter/
  message versus a 4-byte category plus raw text), so `AddReport()` is never
  reached. Fixing it is a command-shape decision, not a mechanical patch. Prov:
  archived board, T146.

## P — process and documentation

- **B024** (P) Component extraction of `class EverQuest` (2,025-line header, 685
  member functions, 178 data members, 37 flat `src/client/eq_*.cpp` TUs) and of
  `class IrrlichtRenderer` is the open structural programme —
  `refactor/K_component_extraction.md`, K01..K13, then Batch L. Both headers hold
  a no-grow allowlist entry that each K unit ratchets down. Prov: the J tracker's
  "WILL'S RULING", 2026-09-02.

- **B025** (P) Eight methods dominate their TUs and were left out of Batch J
  deliberately: `eqt::zone::ZoneComponent::DispatchZonePacket` 880
  (`src/client/zone/zone_dispatch.cpp`, K09),
  `RaceModelLoader::loadModelFromGlobalChrWithVariantsForAnimation` 815
  (`variant_loading.cpp`), `IrrlichtRenderer::updatePlayerMovement` 806
  (`renderer_player_physics.cpp`), `CommandProcessor::registerBuiltinCommands` 768
  (`command_processor_registration.cpp`), `eqt::bridge::BridgeComponent::ProcessBridgeIntents` 580
  (`src/client/bridge/bridge_component_intents.cpp`), `Application::initialize` 569 (`application.cpp`),
  `DetailManager::createDefaultConfig` 548 (`detail_manager.cpp`, a data table —
  leave it), `IrrlichtRenderer::processFrameRender` 546 (`renderer_frame.cpp`).
  Closes when: each is split or explicitly kept. Prov:
  `refactor/J_file_size_reclamation.md`, "Optional, NOT part of this batch".

- **B026** (P) Two unmerged branches have never been audited —
  `task/eqcpp-zoneprocess-track-b-remaining` and
  `task/eqemu-zone-line-transition-scenario`, both measured 300 commits ahead of
  `fable` at this tip, both pre-dating the lettered programme. Closes when: a
  survey unit reports what is in them. Prov: deferred item 22.

- **B027** (P) Something on the eqemu server sets `Oraclerogue`'s persisted `gm`
  flag to 1 — four consecutive live units (T297, T320, T322, T323) saw it, none
  issued `#gm`, and T323 captured it before starting any client. It silently
  changes what a test character can do. **Needs eqemu.** Prov: deferred item 43.

- **B028** (P) Batch Z's Z5.3 empty-draw measurement (one-triangle buffer
  isolation) was never taken. Prov: archived board, Batch Z.

## Added 2026-09-03 by the K07 Review (movement extraction)

- **B029** (B) `src/client/movement/movement_state.cpp` `MovementComponent::m_water_surface_z`
  — written on every water-state change and read by nothing; swim height has
  no consumer. Closes when: a reader exists or the member is deleted. Prov: K07 Review.

- ~~**B030** (B) `include/client/eq.h` `EverQuest::m_swim_up` / `m_swim_down` with
  `SetSwimUp` / `SetSwimDown` — zero readers, zero setter callers.~~ **CLOSED by
  K13**: all four, plus `GetWaterState()` and `IsSwimming()`, had exactly one
  occurrence tree-wide (their own definition) and were deleted; `m_water_state`
  itself moved into `eqt::movement::MovementComponent`, its sole writer. Prov: K07 Review.

- ~~**B031** (B) `include/client/eq.h` `EverQuest::m_last_movement_update` — zero
  references tree-wide.~~ **CLOSED by K15**: re-measured at `7c125b28`, still
  zero; deleted. Prov: K07 Review.

- **B032** (A) `src/client/movement/movement_component.cpp` `MovementComponent::StartMoveForward`
  / `StartMoveBackward` / `StartTurnLeft` / `StartTurnRight` — the keyboard
  movement START half has zero callers while the STOP half is called (T316
  recorded the keep; the switch has no on position). Closes when: the input
  path calls the Start* methods and a live keypress moves the player, or the
  cluster is deleted together with its Stop* half. Prov: K07 Review, T316.

## Added 2026-09-03 by the Batch L survey (`refactor/L_renderer_component_extraction.md`)

- ~~**B033** (B) `include/client/graphics/irrlicht_renderer.h` — 14 methods
  declared and defined nowhere.~~ **CLOSED by K15**: all 14 re-measured at
  `7c125b28` (each had exactly one occurrence tree-wide, its own declaration;
  the offset/rotation pair really does live on `EntityRenderer`) and deleted.
  Prov: Batch L survey.

- **B034** (B) `include/client/graphics/irrlicht_renderer.h` — **SIX of the
  eight CLOSED by K15, and the survey's claim was FALSE for the other two.**
  Deleted: ~~`lastOccCamX_`~~ (with its `lastOccCamY_/Z_` and the whole
  `lastOccFwd{X,Y,Z}` line — the occlusion camera-movement gate was never
  implemented), ~~`hudCallback_`~~ (its only reference was `setHUDCallback`,
  which had zero callers; the `HUDCallback` typedef and the setter went with
  it), ~~`cachedHudText_`~~, ~~`cachedHotkeysText_`~~,
  ~~`cachedHeadingDebugText_`~~. **KEPT: `chatPrefillMutex_` and
  `pendingChatPrefill_` are LIVE** — T319 wired them after the Batch L survey
  was taken. `requestChatPrefill()` writes on the game thread from
  `IrrlichtRenderer::handleActionResult` (`irrlicht_renderer.cpp`) and
  `takeChatPrefill()` reads on the render thread in
  `renderer_frame_input.cpp`; `test_reply_to_tell_key.cpp` covers the trip.
  This entry stays open only as the record of that correction. Prov: Batch L
  survey, corrected by K15.

## Added 2026-09-03 by the K09 Review (zone extraction)

- ~~**B035** (B) `include/client/zone/zone_component.h` `ZoneComponent::m_spawn_appearance_sent`
  / `m_client_spawned` — write-only.~~ **CLOSED by K15**: re-measured at
  `7c125b28` — the only occurrences were the two declarations, the two
  `CleanupZone` resets and one already-commented-out line in
  `src/client/core/everquest.cpp`. Members and resets deleted; the live spawn-ready state
  is `game_state.world().clientReady()`, reset on the adjacent line. The dead
  comment in `eq.cpp` was left in place — that file is K14's territory this
  wave. Prov: K09 Review.

## Added 2026-09-03 by the K11 Review (bridge extraction)

- **B036** (C) `src/client/bridge/bridge_component_ui_audio.cpp` — K11 deleted
  four uncalled wrapper helpers (`PlaySoundAt`, `PlayCombatSound`,
  `PlaySpellSound`, `PlayUISound`) and `SaveEntityDataToFile`. **Corrected
  2026-09-03 against the tree:** melee hits (`src/client/commands/combat_actions.cpp`),
  spell casts (`src/client/player/player_buffs.cpp`), death (`src/client/player/player_state.cpp`),
  doors (`src/client/entities/entities_component_world.cpp`) and water entry
  (`src/client/movement/movement_state.cpp`) all play through `ctx_.audio_manager`
  directly — they were never routed through the deleted wrappers. The only
  genuinely unwired category is UI sounds (clicks, window open/close).
  Will's call whether UI sounds are wanted at all. Prov: K11 Review.

- ~~**B037** (B) `include/client/bridge/bridge_component.h` `m_audio_config_use_3d_audio`
  — settable only by editing the header.~~ **CLOSED by K15 — WIRED, both ends.**
  K11's note claiming the flag was "still read by `InitializeAudio()`" was
  **wrong**: re-measured at `7c125b28`, it had zero writers AND zero readers, so
  a config source alone would have produced a knob that does nothing. It now has
  both: `audio.use_3d` (JSON) / `--no-3d-audio` (CLI) ->
  `AppConfig::audioUse3D` -> `Bridge().SetUse3DAudio()` ->
  `InitializeAudio()` -> `AudioManager::setUse3DAudio()`, which gates the
  spatial branch of `AudioManager::playSoundInternal()` (off = every sound
  plays centred at the effects volume, no attenuation, no panning). Prov:
  K11 Review.

## Added 2026-09-03 by the K13 Review (context services)

- **B038** (B) `include/client/eq.h` — **the `EverQuest&` transition-handle
  residue, measured.** K13 took the twelve components' `owner_.` count from
  **1,425 to 83** (94.2% removed) by turning the four target groups into the
  three context services and the twelve component pointers. What is left is
  eleven distinct members and nine methods, in five clusters, and each cluster
  is a separate small decision rather than one sweep:
  (1) **renderer-lifetime state** — `m_constrained_config` (8),
  `m_graphics_initialized` (5), `m_constrained_preset` (2),
  `m_loading_status_ptr` (1), all `bridge`-only, read by four `src/client/core/everquest.cpp`
  bodies `Application` drives around the K11 forwarders;
  (2) **the loading-phase state machine** — `EverQuest::SetLoadingPhase` (12) +
  `m_loading_phase` (5) + `IsGraphicsReady` (1); not player state, so K13 did
  not fold it into `eqt::PlayerFacade`;
  (3) **lifecycle entry points** — `RequestQuit` (7), `TickNetwork` (3),
  `StartUpdateLoop`/`StopUpdateLoop`/`OnGameStateComplete`/`ConnectToZone`/
  `SetSneak` (1 each) + `m_update_running` (1), `m_pending_logout_disconnect` (3),
  `m_zone_session_established` (1);
  (4) **members with a public `EverQuest` accessor carrying external callers** —
  `m_guild_id` (8) + `m_guild_rank` (2) (`GetGuildID`/`GetGuildRank`, ~20 test
  sites), `m_last_tell_sender` (2) (`GetLastTellSender`, 3 action-handler + 6
  test sites), `m_string_db` (2) via `GetStringMessage` (4) /
  `GetFormattedStringMessage` (3), `m_profile_appearance` (1),
  `m_zone_server_host`/`m_zone_server_port` (1 each);
  (5) **the send-guard test seam** — `m_test_bypass_send_guard` (5).
  Ten of the twelve components still take the handle; only `eqt::gm::GmComponent`
  reached zero and dropped both it and its `friend` line. Closes when: each
  cluster is re-homed or the handle is declared permanent. Prov: K13 Review.

- **B039** (P) **the `friend class` test is two-axis, not one.** K13 removed the
  `friend` lines for merchant and commands on a zero-`owner_.m_` measurement and
  the build failed: a component also names `EverQuest`'s PRIVATE STATICS by
  qualification (`EverQuest::FormatPrice`, `EverQuest::DumpPacket`,
  `EverQuest::s_debug_level`), which friendship grants and no `owner_.` census
  sees. Both lines were restored in-unit. Closes when: `refactor/K_component_extraction.md`
  §Mechanism 7 states the two-axis rule. Prov: K13 Review.
