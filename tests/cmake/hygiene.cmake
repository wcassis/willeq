# K00 Leg B (2026-09-03): the file-size ceiling and the live-doc citation
# checker are enforced tree-wide under ctest, not just as a manual
# verification-bar step run by an executor. Both are pure source/doc scans --
# no build artefact, no server, no display -- so they run in every
# configuration. Labeled "hygiene" (ctest -L hygiene selects just these).
